# OBS
This project is my project developed during my second year at university. It was created when I had limited understanding of object-oriented programming and the code may not be clean. There might still be some errors present. I used MsSQL as the database for this project. You can download and run the program directly.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- MsSQL (version X.X.X)
